2014-07-01  Paul Hardy  <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>

	* doc/unifont.texi: include unihexfill.texi.
	* doc/unihexfill.texi: added file.
	* doc/*.texi: updated all files to cross-reference unihexfill(1).
	* font/Makefile: removed spurious "DF" element in "for"
	  loop to create "compiled/png/csur/" glyphs.
	* font/plane00/unifont-base.hex: changed "y" glyph (U+0079)
	  back to previous version.  Added modification to the
	  German double s glyph (U+00DF) submitted by Joshua Krämer.
	* font/plane01/Makefile: corrected a comment line.
	* man/unihexfill.1: created missing man page.  Without that,
	  this version did not conform to Debian Policy.  The
	  omission drove this release.
	* man/*.[15]: updated all man pages to cross-reference unihexfill(1).

2014-06-29  Paul Hardy  <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>

	* ChangeLog:
	  - File now begins with UTF-8 encoded Byte Order Mark (U+FEFF),
	    which is 0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF.  This will alert some less than
	    well behaved text applications to expect non-ASCII UTF-8
	    characters in this file.
	  - Corrected date in previous ChangeLog entry.
	* font/Makefile: removed an extra "done" in a "for" loop.
	* font/plane00/unifont-base.hex:
	  - Joshua Krämer redrew U+0079 ('y') and U+00B5 (mu).
	  - Paul Hardy redrew U+00DF (German double s), and Gujarati
	    characters U+0ACB and U+0ACC.
	  - Uberon126 redrew symbols U+2672, U+267B, U+267C, U+267D, U+269B,
	    and U+269C.
	  - Uberon126 and Paul Hardy redrew U+262F (yin-yang).
	* font/plane01/plane01.hex:
	  - Paul Hardy added [in order of appearance in Uniocde Plane 1 /
            the SMP]: Meroitic Hieroglyphs, Meroitic Cursive, Avestan,
	    Inscriptional Parthian, Inscriptional Pahlavi, Psalter Pahlavi,
	    Old Turkic, Rumi Numeral Symbols, Brahmi, Kaithi, Kana Supplement,
	    Shorthand Format Controls, Emoticons, and Alchemical Symbols.
	    He also redrew U+01F195 ("NEW").
	  - Nils Dagsson Moskopp drew more glyphs in the Miscellaneous
	    Symbols and Pictographs block.
	  - Ubreon126 contributed the Pahawh Hmong glyphs.  He contributed
	    new Mah Jong glyphs: U+01F010, U+01F022 through U+01F02A.  He
	    also redrew U+01F16A ("MC") and U+01F198 ("SOS").

2014-06-21  Paul Hardy  <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>

	* Changed version numbering from a date at the end to a two-digit
	  release number for a given Unicode version, where a Unicode version
	  consists of a major number and a minor number.  So this version is
	  Unifont 7.0.01, because it is the first revision to implement the
	  Unifont 7.0 glyphs.  Richard Stallman made this request.
	* INSTALL: changed "hexsrc" to "plane00" to refer to the new
	  directory name.
	* README:
	  - Changed "hexsrc" to "plane00" to refer to the new directory name.
	  - Added mention of Andrew Miller writing unifont-viewer.
	* doc/: incorporated unifont-viewer.texi into unifont.texi.
	* doc/Makefile: corrected comments for building texinfo output files,
	  and simplified docprep target.
	* doc/unifont-viewer.texi: added file.
	* doc/unifont.texi:
	  - Corrected naming of section "Using Graphical Tools"; it was
	    incorrectly named "Hex File Format", which is the name of the
	    preceding section.
	  - Added new section on "Dynamically Viewing a Unifont File" to
	    describe using the unifont-viewer Perl utility.
	  - Added unifont-viewer man page sub-section to Reference section.
	* doc/unifontpic.texi: changed "hexsrc" to "plane00" to refer to
	  the new directory name.
	* doc/unigencircles.texi: changed "hexsrc" to "plane00" to refer to
	  the new directory name.
	* font/Makefile:
	  - Added font/plane0[1-F]csur/*.hex in hex: target to sort input
	    for building fonts containing CSUR glyphs above Plane 0.
	  - Added all combining character code points in uppercsurttf target.
	  - Added creation of unifont_upper_sample-$(VERSION).hex.  This
	    involved the creation of combining and nonprinting files in
	    "font/compiled/" directory.  Also added creation of
	    unifont_upper_sample-$(VERSION).bdf and
	    the SBIT font unifont_upper_sample-$(VERSION).ttf.
	  - Added generation of Supplemental Multilingual Plane glyphs
	    to "font/compiled/bmp/" directory.
	  - Renamed "font/compiled/bmp/uni??.bmp" to
	    "font/compiled/bmp/uni00??.bmp" to appear before SMP bitmap files.
	  - compiled/bmp no longer created; replaced with compiled/png.
	  - compiled/png now contains sample glyphs in Portable Network
	    Graphics format (with combining circles where appropriate),
	    in subdirectories "plane00", "plane01", "plane0E", and "csur".
	  - clean target now also removes "$(COMPILED_DIR)/*.sfd.gz".
	* font/index.html: added table for Supplemental Multilingual Plane.
	* font/plane00: Added the 327 new glyphs introduced to Plane 0 in
	  Unicode 7.0.  This involved adding glyphs to unifont-base.hex,
	  adding combining code points to bmp-combining.txt, and removing
	  newly-defined glyphs from unassigned.hex.
	* font/plane00/README: changed "hexsrc" to "plane00" to refer to
	  the new directory name.
	* font/plane00/unifont-base.hex:
	  - Redrew U+0D00 and U+2702.
	  - Redrew Halfwidth Katakana Variants, U+FF65 through U+FF9F, because
	    the original glyphs were too tall compared to the rest of Unifont.
	  - Using new versions of U+2619 (the "Aldus leaf"), U+2622,
	    and U+26DF that Nils Moskopp submitted.
	* font/plane00csur/csur.hex: removed U+EFFF as a Copyleft symbol, as
	  it is not part of the ConScript Unicode Registry.
	* font/plane01/Makefile: created Makefile to generate "unassigned.hex"
	  from "unassigned-ranges.txt".
	* font/plane01/plane01.hex:
	  - Paul Hardy added these scripts: Phaistos Disc, Coptic Epact
	    Numbers, Imperial Aramaic, Lydian, Old South Arabian, Old North
	    Arabian, and Enclosed Ideographic Supplement (modeled after glyphs
	    in Wen Quan Yi).  Also added new glyphs to complete Phoenician.
	    Also added glyphs to complete the 7.0 additions for Ancient Greek
	    Numbers, Ancient Symbols, and Old Italic.
	  - Andrew Miller added new glyphs for Playing Cards and Enclosed
	    Alphanumeric Supplement.  Also drew more glyphs for Mathematical
	    Alphanumeric Supplement.
	  - Nils Moskopp drew the new Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs.
	* font/plane01/unassigned-ranges.txt: completed all unassigned ranges
	  for scripts that the Unicode Consortium has assigned.
	* font/plane01/plane01-nonprinting.hex: created file.
	* man/:
	  - Added references to unifont-viewer in all other man pages.
	  - Removed an extraneous ".PP" that appeared in some man pages before
	    a new section header.
	* man/unifont.5: changed "hexsrc" to "plane00".
	* man/unifont-viewer.1: created file.
	* man/unifontpic.1: changed "hexsrc" to "plane00".

	* src/unifont-viewer: added new program to view Unifont hex files.
	* src/unifontpic.c: changed "6.3" version number to "7.0".
	* src/unigencircles.c: extended to cover the entire Unicode range.
	* src/unihexfill: new program to pad a script with glyphs that are
	  four or six digits.  Among other uses, this will allow Debian
	  GNU/Linux's font review script to report Unicode script completion
	  percentage accurately for Unifont.

2014-02-14  Paul Hardy  <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>

	* COPYING: added GNU Free Documentation License 1.3, which covers
	  the files "doc/unifont.*".
	* ChangeLog: fixed a typo in 2014-02-04 entry.

2014-02-04  Paul Hardy  <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>

	* Makefiles:
	  - Updated date for new release.
	  - Added Qianqian Fang's name to COPYRIGHT strings, for his glyph
            contributions in "font/plane00/wqy.hex".
	* hangul/hangul-generation.html: removed references to three footer
	  "<img>" links that pointed to external websites.  Those external
	  icons were saved locally when the original web page
	  http://unifoundry.com/hangul/hangul-generation.html was saved in
	  the "hangul/" directory.  That web page is the most comprehensive
	  documentation of the effort to create the Hangul Syllables block
	  from scratch.
	* hangul/hangul-generation_files: removed three external icon files
	  ("valid-html401.png", "vccs.gif", and "w3c_ab.gif") that were saved
	  locally when http://unifoundry.com/hangul/hangul-generation.html
	  was saved.
	* src/unibmp2hex.c: increased size of "wide" array to be 0x200000,
	  to cover the entire range of Unicode.

2014-02-02  Paul Hardy  <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>

        * Makefiles: updated date for new release.
	* NEWS: updated for new release.
	* README: updated for new release, notably mentioning that
	  "font/hexsrc" has been renamed to "font/plane00".
	* doc/: regenerated unifont.txt, unifont.info, and unifont.pdf files
	  after addition of doc/hexkinya.texi.
	* doc/Makefile (docprep): added new target to remove the files
	  created by "make doc", in preparation for running "make doc" again.
	* doc/hexkinya.texi: added Texinfo file for hexkinya Perl script.
	* doc/unifont.texi: updated file to reflect "font/hexsrc" being
	  renamed to "font/plane00" and made other changes to reflect
	  support beyond the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane.
	* font/Makefile:
	  - Added Andrew Miller's name to COPYRIGHT string.
	  - Add unifont_upper font files for Plane 1 through Plane 14 glyphs.
	  - Add unifont_upper_csur font files for Plane 1 through Plane 15
	    glyphs (currently there are no glyphs for Plane 16, the highest
	    plane that the  Unicode Standard allows).
	  - Create Unifont-APL8x16.psf.gz console font file, to support
	    running GNU APL and other APL implementations in console mode.
	    This font is a 512 glyph subset of Unifont.
	* font/Makefile (bigpic): construct giant glyph picture using
	  font/plane00/*.hex rather than font/compiled/unifont_sample*.hex,
	  because the latter doesn't contain glyphs for U+FFFE or U+FFFF
	  (removed to appease MS Windows).
	* font/Makefile (hex): added egrep -v "^FFF[EF]" to make sure
          U+FFFE and U+FFFF are removed from font, for Windows XP.

        * font/plane00/nonprinting.hex: removed U+FFFE and U+FFFF to
          appease MS Windows XP (see font/plane00/omit.hex entry below).
        * font/plane00/omit.hex: consists of U+FFFE and U+FFFF, for the
          sake of MS Windows XP.
        * font/plane00/unifont-base.hex: Further tweaks to APL glyphs.
        * font/plane00csur:
	  - Created ConScript Unicode Registry directory, for glyphs in Michael
	    Everson's PUA mapping ("http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/").
          - Added contributions of Wojciech Stryjewski: Tengwar and Klingon.
          - Added contributions of Andrew Miller: Kinya (partial), aUI,
	    Gargoyle, Ewellic, Unifon, Solresol, Visible Speech, and Monofon.
	  - Added contributions of Paul Hardy: Cirth and Aiha.

	    Tai Xuan Jing Symbols, Counting Rod Numerals, Mathematical
	    Alphanumeric Symbols (partial), Mahjong Tiles, Domino Tiles,
	    Playing Cards, Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement, and Miscellaneous
	    Symbols and Pictographs (partial).

	    Notation.
	* font/plane0E: added scripts contributed by Andrew Miller: Tags and
	  Variation Selectors Supplement.
	* font/plane0Fcsur: added glyphs from Michael Everson's ConScript
	  Unicode Registry (CSUR) contriubted by Andrew Miller: Kinya Syllables.
        * font/psf: added directory with files to build new PSF font version,
	  to allow APL use under GNU/Linux in console mode.
	* font/ttfsrc: simplified directory to only contain a Makefile;
	  other files were moved to "font/plane00/" as a precursor to allow
	  parallel building of multiple fonts.
	* font/ttfsrc/Makefile:
	  - Updated VERSION date.
	  - Added Andrew Miller's name to COPYRIGHT string.
	* hangul/README: changed mention of "font/hexsrc" to new location
	  of "font/plane00".
	* man/hexkinya.1: added man page for Andrew Miller's hexkinya Perl
	  script, also cross-referenced in all other man pages.
	* src/hexkinya: new script by Andrew Miller to generate Kinya Private
	  Use Area glyphs in Plane 15, saved under "font/plane0Fcsur/".
	* src/unibmp2hex.c: added forced double width for appropriate
	  Plane 1 (Supplemental Multilingual Plane) scripts now that
	  this package extends beyond the Basic Multilingual Plane.
        * src/unipagecount.c: corrected license from GPL3+ to GPL2+.

2013-12-21  Paul Hardy  <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>

	* ChangeLog: corrected date on last entry from 12-27 to 12-17.
	* Makefiles: updated date for new release.
	* font/hexsrc/unifont-base.hex: Modified glyphs to appear better
	  in APL: U+22F8, U+233B, U+233E, U+235B, and U+2364.
	* font/ttfsrc/Makefile: commented out SetFontNames function calls
	  in fontforge.  Not all applications were interpreting that data
	  correctly.  For example, in LibreOffice, it listed the font as
	  the foundry name ("GNU") rather than the foundry name plus the
	  font name ("GNU Unifont") or just the font name.  That is a bug
	  in LibreOffice, so if such things are fixed in the future then
	  these calls can be re-introduced.
	* src/hex2bdf:
	  - Rearranged some properties (cosmetic change).
	  - Changed default font name from "unifont" to "Unifont".
	* src/unigencircles.c: changed subscript from MAXSTRING to
	  MAXSTRING-1 at line 61.

2013-12-17  Paul Hardy  <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>

	* doc/Makefile: removed redirection of texi2pdf output.
	* doc/unifont.pdf: rebuilt file.
	* font/Makefile:
	  - Don't modify PCF fonts with FontForge, which alters them
	    so grub-mkfont can't read them.
	  - In font/compiled, insert $(VERSION) into unifont.sfd name.
	* font/ttfsrc/Makefile (clean): remove *.bdf, so unifont_sample.bdf
	  is removed.
	* README: removed date stamp at top of file.

2013-12-15  Paul Hardy  <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>

	* src/unihex2png: new program to convert unifont.hex to PNG image.
	* src/unipng2hex: new program to convert PNG image to unifont.hex.
	* src/hex2bdf:
	  - Added new XLFD properties for font generation for FreeType and
	    grub-mkfont support; includes version & copyright info.
	  - Fields now begin with upper-case, including "unifont"-->"Unifont".
	  - Changed POINT_SIZE property from 160 to 120.
	  - Added "Sans" style name to FONT string plus XLFD property.
	  - Added command line options for font name, version, & glyph height.
	  - Allow generation of fonts with other than 16 pixel rows/glyph, to
	    support new capabilities of unihex2png, unipng2hex, and hexdraw.
	* src/unidup.c: now takes an optional file name on the command line.
	* src/*.c: reformatted to follow GNU Coding Standards.
	* man/*: Updated man pages to reflect new options, new programs,
	  and to reflect the GPLv2+ license now common to all programs.
	* doc/: new directory with Texinfo files.
	* ChangeLog: created new file.
	* COPYING: created new file.
	* INSTALL: file created using BUILDING section from old README file.
	* LICENSE: removed; its contents are in README and COPYING now.
	* NEWS: created new file.
	* Makefiles: added "SHELL = /bin/sh" if not already declared.
	* Makefiles (distclean): added removal of "*~" if not already declared.
	* Makefile: compress text files with "gzip -f -9" during installation.
	* font/Makefile: fontforge scripting updated; now adds font copyright,
	  license, version and other info to PCF files.
	* font/hexsrc/unifont-base.hex:
	  - Redrew several Armenian letters (U+0530..U+058F).
	  - Redrew Capricorn symbol (U+2651).
	  - Redrew CJK Radical Supplement glyphs: U+2E9F, U+2EA9, U+2EAC,
	    U+2EAE, U+2EC0, U+2EDE, U+2EE7, and U+2EED.
	* font/ttfsrc/Makefile: fontforge scripting command changed from
	  "Simplify(-1,1)" to "Simplify(64,1)" to "merge lines which are
	  nearly parallel into one".  This decreases the TrueType file size
	  by almost 2 Megabytes, by reducing the number of control points
	  for a glyph.  Also add font copyright, license, version, and
	  other info to TTF files.
	* font/ttfsrc/Makefile: now builds SBIT font unifont_sample.ttf.
	* unifontall-*: renamed to "unifont_sample-*".
	* *.bdf: Added font version, copyright, etc. with hex2bdf.
	* *.pcf: Added font version, copyright, etc. with fontforge.
	* *.ttf: Added font version, copyright, etc. with fontforge.
	* font/*/unifont-*.bmp: Create chart of entire Unifont using pre-built
	  unifont_sample.hex rather than assembling *.hex just for this image.
	* hangul/hangul-generation.html: updated to correct a typo, where
          rieul was mentioned as an initial consonant instead of a final
          consonant in an explanation of vertical spacing constraints.
	* hangul/Makefile:
	  - Updated hex2bdf parameters to name generated BDF font
	    "Unifont Johab" rather than "unifont" and add copyright.
	  - Used a sed script to change BDF encoding from ISO10646 to "Johab".
	  - Call bdftopcf to create hangul-base.pcf, then compress with gzip.
	  - Add "precompiled:" target to create basic Johab font files.

2013-10-20  Paul Hardy  <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>

	* First GNU Project version.
