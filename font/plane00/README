The Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane consists of 2^16 = 65,536 code points.
Of this number, 2,048 are the Surrogate Pairs, from U+D800..U+DFFF.  This
leaves 65,536 - 2,048 = 63,488 code points.

==> The total number of lines in the files below should be 63,488 <==

  hangul-syllables.hex
  omit.hex
  plane00-nonprinting.hex
  plane00-unassigned.hex
  pua.hex
  spaces.hex
  unifont-base.hex
  wqy.hex

The file copyleft.hex contains the Copyleft symbol, which is in the
Supplemental Multilingual Plane (Plane 1); it is added to the TrueType
version of Unifont (even though it lies above Plane 0) because of its
significance.  The custom00.hex file is empty, so it has zero lines.

This makes a total of 63,489 lines in all *.hex files in this directory.

The number of lines can be conveniently determined in this directory with

   wc -l *.hex

The last line will be a grand total, and this should equal 63,489 (with
one line in copyleft.hex).  Here is the output of "wc -l *.hex" with the
Unifont 11.0 glyph files:

      1 copyleft.hex
      0 custom00.hex
  11172 hangul-syllables.hex
      2 omit.hex
     90 plane00-nonprinting.hex
   1643 plane00-unassigned.hex
   6400 pua.hex
     17 spaces.hex
  16314 unifont-base.hex
  27850 wqy.hex
  63489 total

If there are any duplicates, most likely these will be from new
glyphs being added to unifont-base.hex that were not removed from
plane00-unassigned.hex.  A simple comparison using unidup will
show this:

   sort *.hex | unidup

If there are duplicate code points, unidup will print them.

Note that plane00-nonprinting.hex, pua.hex, and plane00-unassigned.hex
might not be included in the final generated unifont.hex file.  If desired,
they can all be added by modifying the make file one level above this
directory (modify the UNIFILES definition in ../Makefile) or with
the call to "make" in the top-level directory with a command such as:

     make UNASSIGNED="plane00/unassigned.hex" PUA="plane00/pua.hex"


Historical Note on wqy.hex
--------------------------
The file "wqy.hex" includes glyphs from the BDF version of Wen Quan Yi
in the range U+4E00..U+9FA5.  That is the CJK Unified Ideographs script
range that was introduced in Unicode 1.0.  In March 2005, The Unicode
Consortium released Unicode 4.1.0, which added 22 new glyphs to that
script in the range U+9FA6..U+9FBB.  Those glyphs were added to Unifont
in February 2008 during the effort to attain complete Unicode 5.1 Basic
Multilingual Plane coverage.  Any additional glyphs added to that Unicode
script in Unifont continue to be added to wqy.hex even though they were
not part of the original Wen Quan Yi font.  This allows keeping the whole
CJK Unified Ideographs script in one file.
